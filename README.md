# WordleSolver

This is a simple Wordle Solver that calculates the best guess by letter frequency.

Included is a txt file called wordlewo.txt which contains all possible wordle answers as of 2022/02/25

Note that the answer list may be changed at any date and I'm working on a v2 with built in scraping tool to ensure this programs has the most updated code.

To use, run solver.py and it would print out the best guess as the word on top.
